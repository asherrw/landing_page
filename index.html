    <h1>Prometheus</h1>
    <p>The Titan lifted the flames from the Gods and offered them to man, hiding the fire inside of a fennel stalk; Prometheus was punished, liver torn, regrown, re-torn each passing day. Chains restricted his body to the peak of the Causcaus mountains, though, his eyes could reach as far as Mestia, a village. He watched the people gather to place their sacred meat upon a pile of wood, kindling, and fennel stalks.</p>
